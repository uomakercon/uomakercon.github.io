  <p>
  What is a makerspace? A makerspace is a physical location where people gather to share resources and knowledge, work on projects, network and as the name implies make.
    <br><br>
    If you love to build and innovate like I do, then you have probably repeatedly faced the issue of where to build your projects. Luckily, Ottawa has great locations for that, and here are the three spaces that will help you in your maker journey.
    <br><br>
    To start off, you might like to visit the “Imagine space” located at Ottawa’s public Library (OPL) in Nepean. This space was originally established in April 2014 with the collaboration of both the US embassy and (OPL), dubbing it as the first makerspace in Ottawa. The space was reopened after a short closure for improvements. Bringing more advanced equipment and doubling the size to meet demand.
    <br><br>
    The facility is equipped with a range of 3D printers and laser cutters. It also has a range of useful equipment for media creators such as cameras and portable green screens in addition too several media programs. The “Imagine space” is a great place to start if you are a modest maker or an aspiring media developer.<br><br>
    The second space is the “Richard L’Abbé Makerspace” Initially funded by the famed Canadian entrepreneur Richard L’Abbé. With the goal to bring innovation and creativity to a faculty that once been consumed by theoretical studies. Ever since then, the makerspace has been going strong with new events, equipment, and workshops available not only to engineering students of University of Ottawa, but other students from all faculties as well. Although the makerspace is a student space, fear not! There are hours for the general public on weekends.<br><br>

    Last but not least, is the “Makerspace North” which was officially opened in 2015 and located in a warehouse space in the City Centre
