<h1>Junior Design</h1><hr />
<h2>About The Competition</h2>
<p>The Junior Innovative Design Competition is a chance for high school students (grade 9-12) to demonstrate their maker abilities. This competition will challenge students to develop an innovative solution in any discipline. Each team or individual will design, build and operate their prototype. The goal is to challenge both the team&rsquo;s design skills and their ability to present the design to our panel of judges. Entrants will be given a booth on Saturday, October 27, 2018, from 11:30am-1:00 pm, to display their prototype while the public, conference attendees and judges view the prototypes and discuss the designs. First and second place winner are eligible for prizes</p>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<p>All entrants must have a prototype at the competition on October 27, 2018. If a prototype can&rsquo;t be supplied, the entrant must submit a one-page document detailing why.

<h3>Judging</h3>
<p>All entrants will be evaluated on a standardized scoring scale out of 50 points by a panel of judges. The panel will visit each entrant at their designated table. Entrants shall be informed before the beginning of the competition the time of their judging. Each entrant will be given 3 minutes to present their design followed by 2 minutes which are designated for questions that the judges may have (i.e. How much would it cost to make this prototype? How does the prototype work? Who is this prototype designed for?).</p>
